# Software Module Exercises

This repository contains all the exercises referenced in SERT's software module. The exercises are all located in
the `src/main/kotlin/org/sert2521/softwaremodule/` directory and are organized by section.

## Getting started

To get started with using these exercises, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository.
    * To clone the repository is very simple using a tool called Git. If you are considering joining the software team,
    you should probably use this method as the software team uses Git to manage their projects anyway. You can download
    Git [here](https://git-scm.com). Once downloaded, type this command in the command log, and see as the project files
    get added to your current directory.
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/SouthEugeneRoboticsTeam/software-module-exercizes.git
    ```
    * If you do not want to use Git, just press __Clone or download__ then __Download ZIP__. This will download the
    project as a ZIP file, which you can then extract.
2. Open the project.
    * It is recommended that you use IntelliJ IDEA to work with the exercises, as it is what the software team primarily
    uses and also has the best support for Kotlin out of any other IDE. You can download IntelliJ IDEA 
    [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
3. You can now edit and run the examples using IntelliJ or your IDE of choice. Enjoy ðŸ˜„!
